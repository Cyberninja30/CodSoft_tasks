**Project: Python Utility Applications (CodSoft Tasks)**

CodSoft presents an excellent opportunity for us to enhance our coding skills through the implementation of various utility applications using Python. This project comprises a series of tasks aimed at developing practical applications to manage tasks, perform calculations, generate passwords, play games, and manage contacts.

### Task 1: To-Do List Application

A To-Do List application is designed to help users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. This task involves creating a command-line or GUI-based application within CodSoft, enabling users to create, update, and track their to-do lists seamlessly.

### Task 2: Simple Calculator

In this task, we aim to design a straightforward calculator application capable of performing basic arithmetic operations. By leveraging Python, users can input two numbers and select an operation to obtain the result swiftly.

### Task 3: Password Generator

A Password Generator is a valuable tool for creating strong, random passwords. Through CodSoft, we'll develop an application where users can specify the desired length of the password, and the generator will produce a secure password using random characters.

### Task 4: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Implementing a Rock-Paper-Scissors game provides an engaging way to practice coding skills. With CodSoft, we'll prompt users to select rock, paper, or scissors, while the computer generates a random choice. This task includes implementing game logic and optionally tracking scores for multiple rounds.

### Task 5: Contact Management System

Managing contacts efficiently is crucial, and CodSoft offers the perfect platform to build a Contact Management System. Users can store, view, search, update, and delete contacts seamlessly. The application will include features such as adding new contacts, searching by name or phone number, and updating contact details.

These tasks not only offer practical utility but also serve as valuable learning experiences to improve our coding proficiency. With CodSoft's support, we have the opportunity to explore various Python programming concepts and refine our skills effectively.
